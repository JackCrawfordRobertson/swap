      <p><strong>Last Updated: [Date]</strong></p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the use of this website (the "Website"). By accessing or using the Website, you agree to comply with these Terms in full. If you do not agree with these Terms, please refrain from using the Website.

      <h2>2. Access to the Website</h2>
      <h3>2.1</h3>

      <h2>3. Venue Listings and Bookings</h2>
      <h3>3.1</h3>
      <p>
        While corporate venue listings are available on the Website, the presence of a listing does not guarantee a booking. Bookings are subject to availability, potential conflicts of interest, or competitor restrictions.
      </p>
      <h3>3.2</h3>
      <p>
        Users are prohibited from booking venues if they are a competitor or pose a potential conflict of interest. ICE SWAP reserves the right to determine what constitutes a conflict of interest at its sole discretion.
      </p>
      <h3>3.3</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of no response to a booking inquiry, users must not directly contact the corporate venue. Lack of response may indicate a conflict of interest or unavailability, and chasing users directly is strictly prohibited. All enquiries must be via the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Confidentiality</h2>
      <h3>4.1</h3>
      <p>
